            <h1>What is this?</h1>

            <p>
              Did you ever thought about having a reliable digital poll with
              zero trust?
            </p>
            <p>
              Using modern cryptography, we can have absolutely secure and
              absolutely anonymous polls.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of crypto technologies, there are no more uncertainties:
              either voting is fair and transparent to everyone, or solid
              evidence of fraud is provided.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, the voting organizer creates a new poll in the web
              interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Poll Wizard will help to set up the start and end dates and to
              enter a list of participants' emails.

            <h1>Registration phase</h1>
            <p>
              During this phase, every participant receives an email with a
              public link to observe the voting and a private registration link.
            </p>
            <p>
              By following the registration link from the email, each
              participant lands on a secure web page that generates a key pair
              and publishes the public key.
            </p>
            <p>
              A participant is registered when their public key is received and
              published on the observing web page.

            <p>
              During this phase, each participant returns to the secure web page
              (via the email link or from bookmarks), fills out the ballot, and
              clicks the submit button.
            </p>
            <p>
              This button performs an in-browser signature of the ballot
              (meaning that the private key never leaves the participant's
              device) and then uploads the signed document to the system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of the ring signature, it is impossible to know who
              exactly signed the ballot, and it is also impossible to perform
              double-voting.

              During this phase, the system stops receiving ballots. Every
              observer has the same list of signed ballots.
            </p>
            <p>
              The voting organizer publishes the results, which are verifiable
              by every observer.

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <p>
              I do not trust voting authority or this system, is it secure? Yes,
              this is fully zero-trust environment so you do not have to trust
              anyone. The system is open-source, based on Monero's LSAG
              implementation, and have available public API for alternative
              clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              How can I be sure that my vote is counted? You can verify the
              results by yourself. The system is fully transparent and
              verifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Can I vote multiple times? No, the system is designed to prevent
              double-voting and to ensure that every vote is unique. This is
              done by using ring signatures and key images.
            </p>
            <p>
              My environment requires that intermediate results are hidden. Is
              it possible? Yes, voting organizer can add a temporary public key
              which will be used to encrypt every ballot. When voting is done
              then the key will be published and everyone can decrypt the
              results.

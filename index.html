              This is the voting platform designed with modern cryptography to

            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Easy-to-use, digital polling in zero-trust environment.</p>
            <p>
              Thanks to cryptographic technology, you can trust that voting is
              either completely fair and transparent, or that irrefutable
              evidence of fraud is available.

            <h1>How to Use</h1>
            <p>
              First, the voting organizer creates a new poll through the web
              interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Poll Wizard will guide you through all necessary steps, such
              as setting poll start and end dates and providing a list of
              participants emails.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h1>Registration Phase</h1>
            <p>
              During this phase, each participant receives an email containing a
              private registration link and a public observation link to monitor
              the voting process.
            </p>
            <p>
              By following the registration link, participants are directed to a
              secure webpage where a cryptographic key pair, including a private
              and public key, is generated. The public key is then sent to the
              system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Registration is confirmed once the public key is received and
              listed on the observation page.
            </p>

            <h1>Voting Phase</h1>
            <p>
              During this phase, each participant returns to the secure webpage
              (via the email link or from bookmarks), fills out their ballot,
              and clicks the submit button.
            </p>
            <p>
              Clicking the submit button performs an in-browser signature of the
              ballot, ensuring that the private key never leaves the
              participant's device. The signed document is then uploaded to the
              system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to the use of ring signatures, it is impossible to determine
              who exactly signed the ballot, and double-voting is prevented.

            <p>
              During this phase, the system stops accepting ballots. Every
              observer has access to the same list of signed ballots.
            </p>
            <p>
              The voting organizer then publishes the results, which can be
              verified by every observer.

                >I do not trust the voting authority or this system. Is it
                secure?</strong
              ><br />
              Yes, this platform operates in a fully zero-trust environment,
              meaning you do not have to trust anyone. The system is
              open-source, based on Monero's LSAG implementation, and provides a
              public API for alternative clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>How can I be sure that my vote is counted?</strong><br />
              You can verify the results yourself. The system is fully
              transparent and verifiable.

            <p>
              <strong>Can I vote multiple times?</strong><br />
              No, the system is designed to prevent double-voting and ensure
              that every vote is unique. This is achieved using ring signatures
              and key images.

                Is it possible?</strong
              ><br />
              Yes, the voting organizer can add a temporary public key to
              encrypt each ballot. Once voting is complete, the corresponding
              temporary private key will be published, allowing everyone to
              decrypt and verify the results.
